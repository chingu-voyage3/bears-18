# Introduction
TIQA provides a platform to new developers, those recently graduated or wish to experience remote work in a friendly environment, where they provide their services for free until a certain amount of projects have been met. Afterwards, they can inform new clients of a hourly, monthly or project based income. 

This builds confidence, experience, improves resume and overall, increases potential of acquiring a dream job. Employers/Project owners who hire free developers can get their projects completed (if the project is a certain size) without having to spend a dime, creating a win-win situation for both parties. Developers who attain the paid feature, can continue to thrive on TIQA, earning an income.
